# Occupancy Count and Airport Shop Report Fixes

## Overview
This update addresses two critical issues in the Airplane Mode system:

1. **Occupancy Count Issue**: Fixed the problem where flight occupancy was showing 0 despite having booked tickets
2. **Airport Shop Report Error**: Resolved the error when accessing the Airport Shop Report

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Flight Occupancy Calculation
**Problem**: Flight occupancy was always showing 0 even when tickets were booked.

**Solution**: 
- Added `occupancy_count` and `occupancy_percentage` fields to Airplane Flight DocType
- Implemented automatic occupancy calculation when tickets are created, updated, or cancelled
- Added real-time occupancy tracking with percentage calculation

**Files Modified**:
- `airplane_mode/airplane_mode/doctype/airplane_flight/airplane_flight.py` - Added occupancy calculation logic
- `airplane_mode/airplane_mode/doctype/airplane_flight/airplane_flight.json` - Added occupancy fields to DocType
- `airplane_mode/hooks.py` - Added document events for automatic occupancy updates
- `airplane_mode/patches/add_occupancy_fields_to_airplane_flight.py` - Migration patch for existing data
- `airplane_mode/patches.txt` - Updated to include the new patch

### 2. Airport Shop Report Access
**Problem**: Airport Shop Report was throwing errors when accessed.

**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive Airport Shop Report with proper filters and data visualization
- Added contract status tracking and revenue calculation
- Implemented proper error handling and permission checking

**Files Created**:
- `airplane_mode/airplane_mode/report/airport_shop_report/airport_shop_report.py` - Report logic
- `airplane_mode/airplane_mode/report/airport_shop_report/airport_shop_report.json` - Report configuration

## 🚀 Installation & Deployment

### For New Installations
The fixes are included automatically when you install the app fresh.

### For Existing Installations
1. **Pull the latest code**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/frappe-bench
   bench get-app --branch main https://github.com/macrobian88/frappe_ariplane_mode.git
   ```

2. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   bench --site your-site-name migrate
   ```

3. **Restart services**:
   ```bash
   bench restart
   ```

4. **Manual occupancy recalculation** (if needed):
   ```python
   # In Frappe console
   from airplane_mode.airplane_mode.doctype.airplane_flight.airplane_flight import recalculate_all_flight_occupancy
   recalculate_all_flight_occupancy()
   ```

## 📊 Usage

### Viewing Flight Occupancy
1. Go to **Airplane Flight** list
2. Occupancy information is now displayed in list view columns:
   - **Booked Passengers**: Number of confirmed tickets
   - **Occupancy %**: Percentage of capacity filled
3. Open any flight document to see detailed occupancy section

### Using Airport Shop Report
1. Navigate to **Reports** → **Airport Shop Report**
2. Use filters to narrow down results:
   - **Airport**: Filter by specific airport
   - **Shop Type**: Filter by shop category
   - **Terminal**: Filter by terminal location
   - **Status**: Filter by shop status
3. View comprehensive shop information including contracts and revenue

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Occupancy Calculation Logic
```python
def calculate_occupancy(self):
    # Count all non-cancelled tickets
    booked_tickets = frappe.db.count(
        "Airplane Ticket",
        filters={
            "flight": self.name,
            "docstatus": ["!=", 2]  # Exclude cancelled
        }
    )
    
    # Calculate percentage
    if self.capacity and self.capacity > 0:
        occupancy_percentage = round((booked_tickets / self.capacity) * 100, 2)
    
    # Update fields
    frappe.db.set_value("Airplane Flight", self.name, {
        "occupancy_count": booked_tickets,
        "occupancy_percentage": occupancy_percentage
    })
```

### Document Events Added
- **Airplane Ticket**:
  - `after_insert`: Updates flight occupancy when new ticket created
  - `on_update`: Updates flight occupancy when ticket modified
  - `on_cancel`: Updates flight occupancy when ticket cancelled
  - `on_trash`: Updates flight occupancy when ticket deleted

### Scheduled Tasks
- **Daily**: Recalculate all flight occupancy to ensure data integrity
- **Background Jobs**: Use Frappe's job queue for performance optimization

## 🎫 Demo Data Impact
The demo tickets created earlier now properly show in flight occupancy:

- **Flight EMIRATES-09-2025-00001**: 
  - Capacity: 426 passengers
  - Booked: 5 tickets
  - Occupancy: 1.17%

## 🐛 Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing data
