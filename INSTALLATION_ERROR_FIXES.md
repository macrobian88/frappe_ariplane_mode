# 🔧 Installation Error Fixes - Airport Rent Management

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### ❌ **Error 1: Missing Method in Rent Remainder Alerts**
```
airplane_mode.airport_shop_management.doctype.rent_remainder_alerts.rent_remainder_alerts.check_rent_due_alerts is not a valid method
```

**✅ Solution Applied:**
- Added missing `check_rent_due_alerts()` method to `rent_remainder_alerts.py`
- This method is called by the daily scheduler as defined in `hooks.py`
- The method now properly creates and sends rent reminder alerts

### ❌ **Error 2: Workspace Configuration Issues**

[Workspace, Airplane Mode]: number_card_name, number_card_name... type, type, type...
```
