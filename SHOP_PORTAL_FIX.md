# 🔧 Shop Portal Fix - Testing Guide

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: `https://airplane-mode.m.frappe.cloud/shop-portal` was showing "There's nothing here"

**Root Cause**: Missing `shop-portal.py` context file

**Fix Applied**: 
1. ✅ Created `airplane_mode/www/shop-portal.py` with proper context function
2. ✅ Enhanced `airplane_mode/api/shop_portal.py` with better error handling and sample data
3. ✅ Fixed API field mappings to match frontend expectations

## 🚀 Quick Testing Steps

### 1. Deploy the Fix
```bash
# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Migrate (if needed)
bench --site airplane-mode.m.frappe.cloud migrate

# Clear cache
bench --site airplane-mode.m.frappe.cloud clear-cache

# Restart services
bench restart
```

### 2. Test the Shop Portal
Navigate to: `https://airplane-mode.m.frappe.cloud/shop-portal`

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Page loads with hero section and shop portal interface
- ✅ Shows sample shop data (5 shops by default)
- ✅ Filtering works (by shop type, area, search)
- ✅ Shop cards display properly with pricing
- ✅ Statistics show in the top section

### 3. Test Shop Application
1. Click "Apply Now" on any shop
2. Fill out the application form
3. Submit application

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Application modal opens properly
- ✅ Form validation works
- ✅ Success message appears after submission
- ✅ Lead gets created (or logged as Communication)

## 📊 Sample Data Included

The API now includes 5 sample shops when no real data exists:

1. **Terminal 1 Food Court A1** - ₹1,00,000/month (Food Court, 500 sqft)
2. **Duty Free Shop B2** - ₹2,40,000/month (Duty Free, 800 sqft) 
3. **Retail Store C1** - ₹45,000/month (Normal, 300 sqft)
4. **Premium Boutique D1** - ₹4,80,000/month (Normal, 1200 sqft)
5. **Coffee Kiosk E1** - ₹45,000/month (Stall, 150 sqft)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If page still shows "There's nothing here":
1. Check if migration ran successfully
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check logs: `tail -f logs/web.log`

### If API errors occur:
```bash
# Check error logs
tail -f logs/web.error.log

# Test API directly
curl "https://airplane-mode.m.frappe.cloud/api/method/airplane_mode.api.shop_portal.get_available_shops"
```

### If no shops appear:
- The API includes fallback sample data
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API response in Network tab
