## Airport Management System (Frappe Airplane Mode)

This document provides solutions to common installation issues with the Airport Management System app.

## üö® Recent Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

#### ‚ùå Error: Required app not found 'erpnext'

**Problem:** The app was failing to install due to ERPNext dependency when installing on sites without ERPNext.

**Root Cause:** The `required_apps` included both "frappe" and "erpnext", making ERPNext mandatory.

**Solution Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Modified `required_apps = ["frappe"]` for standalone installation
2. ‚úÖ Added documentation about re-enabling ERPNext if needed
3. ‚úÖ Made the app compatible with sites both with and without ERPNext

#### ‚ùå Error: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extend'

**Problem:** The app installation fails during the hooks loading phase with: `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extend'`

**Root Cause:** Some hooks were configured incorrectly:
- `boot_session` was a string instead of list
- Some other hooks had wrong data types

**Solution Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Fixed `boot_session` to be a list: `boot_session = ["airplane_mode.utils.boot_session"]`
2. ‚úÖ Ensured `auth_hooks` is properly defined as list
3. ‚úÖ Fixed `global_search_doctypes` to be list format
4. ‚úÖ Validated all hook configurations

## üöÄ Installation Commands

### Quick Installation (Fixed Version)

```bash
# Install the fixed version
bench get-app https://github.com/macrobian88/frappe_ariplane_mode.git

# Install on your site
bench --site your-site-name install-app airplane_mode

# Run migrations
bench --site your-site-name migrate
```

### If You Want ERPNext Integration

If you need ERPNext integration, modify `airplane_mode/hooks.py`:

```python
# Change this line:
required_apps = ["frappe"]

# To this:
required_apps = ["frappe", "erpnext"]
```

## üîß Diagnostic Tools

### Hooks Validator

Run our custom validator to check for configuration issues:

```bash
# Download and run the validator
python validate_hooks.py airplane_mode/hooks.py

# Or run from the app directory
python validate_hooks.py
```

The validator will check for:
- ‚úÖ Correct list vs dict configurations
- ‚úÖ ERPNext dependency warnings
- ‚úÖ Common hooks that cause extend() errors
- ‚úÖ Airport Management System specific configurations

### Manual Validation

Check these common issues in your `hooks.py`:

1. **Required Apps Format:**
   ```python
   # ‚úÖ Correct (standalone):
   required_apps = ["frappe"]
   
   # ‚úÖ Correct (with ERPNext):
   required_apps = ["frappe", "erpnext"]
   
   # ‚ùå Wrong:
   # required_apps = []  # Commented out
   ```

2. **Boot Session Format:**
   ```python
   # ‚úÖ Correct:
   boot_session = ["airplane_mode.utils.boot_session"]
   
   # ‚ùå Wrong:
   boot_session = "airplane_mode.utils.boot_session"
   ```

3. **Auth Hooks Format:**
   ```python
   # ‚úÖ Correct:
   auth_hooks = ["airplane_mode.auth.validate_user_permissions"]
   
   # ‚ùå Wrong:
   auth_hooks = "airplane_mode.auth.validate_user_permissions"
   ```

## üìã Common Error Patterns & Solutions

### Pattern 1: extend() Error
```
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extend'
```
**Quick Fix:**
1. Check hooks.py for hooks defined as single strings that should be lists
2. Common culprits: `boot_session`, `auth_hooks`, `global_search_doctypes`
3. Use our validator: `python validate_hooks.py`

### Pattern 2: ERPNext Dependency Error
```
Required app not found 'erpnext'
```
**Quick Fix:**
1. Change `required_apps = ["frappe", "erpnext"]` to `required_apps = ["frappe"]`
2. Only add ERPNext back if you specifically need ERPNext integration

### Pattern 3: Import Errors
```
ImportError: No module named 'airplane_mode.something'
```
**Solution:**
1. Ensure all referenced modules exist
2. Check file paths in hook configurations
3. Verify DocType names match exactly

2. **Uninstall the old app:**
   ```bash
   bench --site your-site-name uninstall-app airplane_mode
   ```
3. **Install the fixed version:**
   ```bash
   bench get-app https://github.com/macrobian88/frappe_ariplane_mode.git
   bench --site your-site-name install-app airplane_mode
   ```
4. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   bench --site your-site-name migrate
   ```

## üß™ Testing Your Installation

After successful installation:

1. **Check App Lists:**
