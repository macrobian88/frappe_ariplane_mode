This document provides solutions to common installation issues with the Airport Management System app.

## üö® CRITICAL FIX - Latest Issue (September 2025)

### ‚ùå Error: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extend' - RESOLVED

**ERROR MESSAGE:**
```
An error occurred while installing airplane_mode: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extend'
...
key = ********
value = ['Airport Shop', 'Shop Lead', 'Contract Shop']
builtins.AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extend'
```

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** 
The `standard_doctypes` hook with the specific value `['Airport Shop', 'Shop Lead', 'Contract Shop']` was causing Frappe's hook extension mechanism to fail.

**SOLUTION APPLIED:**
1. ‚úÖ **Removed the problematic `standard_doctypes` hook completely**
2. ‚úÖ **Added extensive documentation to prevent re-introduction**
3. ‚úÖ **Enhanced validator to detect this specific issue**
4. ‚úÖ **Confirmed the app works perfectly without this hook**

## üöÄ Quick Fix Installation

```bash
# Install the latest fixed version (September 2025)
bench get-app https://github.com/macrobian88/frappe_ariplane_mode.git

# Install on your site
bench --site your-site-name install-app airplane_mode

# Run migrations
bench --site your-site-name migrate
```

## üîß If You're Still Getting the Error

### Immediate Action Required:

1. **Check your hooks.py file** for this line:
   ```python
   standard_doctypes = ["Airport Shop", "Shop Lead", "Contract Shop"]
   ```

2. **Remove or comment out the line:**
   ```python
   # standard_doctypes = ["Airport Shop", "Shop Lead", "Contract Shop"]  # REMOVED - causes extend() error
   ```

3. **Run the validator:**
   ```bash
   python validate_hooks.py airplane_mode/hooks.py
   ```

4. **Reinstall the app:**
   ```bash
   bench --site your-site-name uninstall-app airplane_mode
   bench --site your-site-name install-app airplane_mode
   ```

## üö® Previous Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

#### ‚ùå Error: Required app not found 'erpnext'

**Problem:** The app was failing to install due to ERPNext dependency when installing on sites without ERPNext.

**Root Cause:** The `required_apps` included both "frappe" and "erpnext", making ERPNext mandatory.

**Solution Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Modified `required_apps = ["frappe"]` for standalone installation
2. ‚úÖ Added documentation about re-enabling ERPNext if needed
3. ‚úÖ Made the app compatible with sites both with and without ERPNext

#### ‚ùå Error: Other 'dict' object has no attribute 'extend' cases

**Problem:** Various hooks were configured incorrectly causing extend() errors.

**Root Cause:** Some hooks were configured as strings or dicts when they should be lists.

**Solution Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Fixed `boot_session` to be a list: `boot_session = ["airplane_mode.utils.boot_session"]`
2. ‚úÖ Ensured `auth_hooks` is properly defined as list
3. ‚úÖ Fixed `global_search_doctypes` to be list format
4. ‚úÖ Validated all hook configurations

## üîß Diagnostic Tools

### Enhanced Hooks Validator

Run our updated validator to check for all known issues:

```bash
# Download and run the enhanced validator
python validate_hooks.py airplane_mode/hooks.py

# Expected output: ‚úÖ VALIDATION PASSED
```

The validator now specifically checks for:
- ‚úÖ The exact problematic `standard_doctypes` hook
- ‚úÖ All list vs dict configurations
- ‚úÖ ERPNext dependency warnings
- ‚úÖ Common hooks that cause extend() errors
- ‚úÖ Airport Management System specific configurations

### Manual Validation

Check these critical configurations in your `hooks.py`:

1. **Standard DocTypes (CRITICAL):**
   ```python
   # ‚ùå NEVER define this - causes extend() error:
   # standard_doctypes = ["Airport Shop", "Shop Lead", "Contract Shop"]
   
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT - don't define it at all (commented out or removed)
   ```

2. **Required Apps Format:**
   ```python
   # ‚úÖ Correct (standalone):
   required_apps = ["frappe"]
   
   # ‚úÖ Correct (with ERPNext):
   required_apps = ["frappe", "erpnext"]
   ```

3. **Boot Session Format:**
   ```python
   # ‚úÖ Correct:
   boot_session = ["airplane_mode.utils.boot_session"]
   
   # ‚ùå Wrong:
   boot_session = "airplane_mode.utils.boot_session"
   ```

4. **Auth Hooks Format:**
   ```python
   # ‚úÖ Correct:
   auth_hooks = ["airplane_mode.auth.validate_user_permissions"]
   
   # ‚ùå Wrong:
   auth_hooks = "airplane_mode.auth.validate_user_permissions"
   ```

## üìã Error Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: extend() Error with Standard DocTypes
```
value = ['Airport Shop', 'Shop Lead', 'Contract Shop']
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extend'
```
**Quick Fix:** Remove or comment out the `standard_doctypes` hook completely.

### Pattern 2: extend() Error with Other Hooks
```
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'extend'
```
**Quick Fix:**
1. Run validator: `python validate_hooks.py`
2. Check hooks.py for hooks defined as strings that should be lists
3. Common culprits: `boot_session`, `auth_hooks`, `global_search_doctypes`

### Pattern 3: ERPNext Dependency Error
```
Required app not found 'erpnext'
```
**Quick Fix:**
1. Change `required_apps = ["frappe", "erpnext"]` to `required_apps = ["frappe"]`
2. Only add ERPNext back if you specifically need ERPNext integration

### Pattern 4: Import Errors
```
ImportError: No module named 'airplane_mode.something'
```
**Solution:**
1. Ensure all referenced modules exist
2. Check file paths in hook configurations
3. Verify DocType names match exactly
